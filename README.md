# Mario Kart 7 Anti Cheat V2

This is a cheat plugin created for the game Mario Kart 7 with the sole purpose of removing cheaters from online matches, enabling users of the plugin to race without issue. The need for a Mario Kart 7 anti-cheat arose around 2018 when once private OP cheat were released to the public. This plugin aims to fight against most common cheat codes.
